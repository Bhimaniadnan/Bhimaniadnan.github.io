Today, I have been studying:

Using Mimo (https://getmimo.com)
Whenever you are unable to have a computer in your lap, its perfect to be able to have your phone (which every has in their hands anyways) and just start coding. I would suggest this to anyone and everyone wanting to learn. 
I have been learning Javascript currently:
Advanced functions including conditions and loops.
Updates from ES6 ( also known as ECMAScript 2015) which is the second Javascript revision.


Using Github to actively back updates to my blog ( using Jekyll, HTML, and CSS )
