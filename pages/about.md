Welcome to the Bhimani Blog! 

My name is Adnan Bhimani and I am here details my days in my tech journey and sharing what I can to help others.

I have been working as an IT Specialist for 3 years now and on! I strive to be a software developer and I am actively learning everyday to get to this goal.

The languages that I am currently learning are:

HTML ( Done )
CSS ( Done )
Javascript (+react)
Python
SQL
Java

I know there will always be more to learn so I will never stop learning these languages. The projects I create will be posted here!
